# Mario-Luigi-Dream-Team-NTR-Plugin
Mario & Luigi Dream Team (USA) cheat plugin for NTR CFW

This was tested on BootNTR.cia (NTR 2.4), with an O3DS XL, Luma CFW 11.0 SysNAND, Mario and Luigi Dream Team cia version with no patches installed (may with the patch installed but I haven't tested it). This plugin was based off of Godson's addresses from Fort42 for Gateway.

Features:
Press R+UP/Down:
- Will add/subtract 1, 5, or 10 (configurable from cheat menu) to a specific stat (configurable from cheat menu) to either Mario or Luigi (also configurable via cheat menu)
- 999,999 coins cheat in cheat menu.


Usage:
Copy the file cheat.plg to /plugin/00040000000D5A00/ in  sd/microsd card, boot to NTR and press R+UP to increase the stat or R+DOWN to decrease the stat. Please make sure that when using the cheat menu to configure the stats that only mario or luigi are selected between those two, only 1 stat is selected, and that only one value modifier (+1, +5, +10) is selected. The default values are set to (Mario | HP | 1)

Note:
The subtraction works funky with HP or BP so be careful that you don't make it go below 0.
